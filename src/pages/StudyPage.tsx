      <h2>How to read</h2>
      <p>
        Open any title from <Link to="/church-fathers">Browse</Link> or the Writings list in the header. The whole work sits on
        one page; use the chapter strip to jump. <strong>Translation</strong> shows the English edition; <strong>Original</strong>{" "}
        shows Latin (or Greek) when we have it. Turn on <strong>Split</strong> in the rail to keep both columns.{" "}
        <strong>Refs</strong> and <strong>Notes</strong> reveal scripture links and edition footnotes — they start off so the page
        stays a clean reading column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search accepts a keyword (<em>incarnation</em>, <em>restless</em>), a work and chapter (<em>Confessions 8</em>), or a
        father&apos;s name. Results are ordered through the corpus the way a Bible app orders a Find — by era, then author, then
        work and chapter.
